Spaces are the places in Balsamiq Cloud where you keep your wireframe projects. Most people will only need a single space for their projects, but some folks may find it useful to split their work between multiple spaces (one for work and one for personal projects, for example).

If you log into Balsamiq Cloud with an account that doesn't yet belong to a space, you will be prompted to [create a new Space](#creating-a-new-space).

(If you were [invited](../people/#inviting-someone-to-a-project) by someone else, you will see their Space.)

If you already have access to one or more Spaces, you will see them listed when you log in. You can access any of your existing Spaces, or create a new one. To access an existing Space, simply click on it, and you will be brought to that Space's [project page](../projects/).

## Creating a New Space

To create a new Balsamiq Cloud Space, **click the plus button in the upper left corner** of your Spaces Homepage. A screen will pop up asking you to name the Space, and remind you of our subscription tiers.

Give your Space a name and click the **Create Space & Start Free Trial** to create it.

## Managing Your Space Settings

Once in your Space, you can access the Space settings by clicking the **Settings** link at the top of the page. From this page you can change/add [Space Owners](../people/#space-owners) or delete the Space completely.

### Changing and Adding Space Owners

In Balsamiq Cloud, you can specify up to two [Space Owners](../people/#space-owners) per Space. By default, the Space's creator will be Space Owner, but that can be changed by selecting another [Staff Member](../people/#staff-members) from the dropdown.

You can specify a second Space Owner via the second dropdown. A second Space Owner can be great for sharing the administrative load!

### Deleting Your Balsamiq Cloud Space

Deleting a Space can only be done by the [Space Owner](../people/#space-owners). To do this, type the name of the Space and click the **Delete Space** button. If you have an active subscription for the Space, deleting the Space will cancel it.

{{% alert warning %}}**Note:** Deleting a Space cannot be undone. All of your project data will be deleted immediately, with no way to recover it. {{% /alert %}}

## Managing Users

Clicking the **People** link at the top of the page will show a list of all the users of the Space and the projects they belong to. Click on the number of projects they belong to to see a list.

Add users by entering one or more email addresses in the box at the bottom of the page.

### Making Someone a Staff Member

Checking the "Staff" checkbox will make someone a Staff Member, allowing them to create and own projects. See [People and Permissions](../people/#staff-members) to learn more about their privileges.

### Deleting Users

To remove a person from the Space, click the **X** to the far right of their name. They will no longer be able to access any projects, except those that allow [public (anonymous) reviews](../people/#allow-public-reviews).
