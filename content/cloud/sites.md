When you log into Balsamiq Cloud for the first time, you will be prompted to [create a new site](#creating-a-new-site). If you were [invited](../people/#inviting-someone-to-a-project) by someone else, then you will should also see their site.

If you already have one or more sites, you will see them listed when you log in. From this page you can access any of your existing sites, or create a new one. To access an existing site, simply click on it, and you will be brought to that site's [project page](../projects/).

## Managing Your Site Settings

Once in your site, you can access the site settings by clicking the **Settings** link at the top of the page. From this page you can change/add [Site Owners](../people/#site-owners) or delete the site completely.

### Changing and Adding Site Owners

In Balsamiq Cloud, you can specify up to two [Site Owners](../people/#site-owners) per site. By default, the site's creator will be Site Owner, but that can be changed by selecting another [Staff Member](../people/#staff-members) from the dropdown.

You can specify a second Site Owner via the second dropdown. A second Site Owner can be great for sharing the administrative load!

### Deleting Your Balsamiq Cloud Site

Deleting a site can only be done by the [Site Owner](../people/#site-owners). To do this, type the name of the site and click the **Delete Site** button. If you have an active subscription for the site, deleting the site will cancel it.

{{% alert warning %}}**Note:** Deleting a site cannot be undone. All of your project data will be deleted immediately, with no way to recover it. {{% /alert %}}

### Deleting Users

To remove a person from the site, click the **X** to the far right of their name. They will no longer be able to access any projects, except those that allow [public (anonymous) reviews](../people/#allow-public-reviews).
