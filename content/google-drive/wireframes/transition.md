Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive was released in July, 2017. The new version has a brand new editor (no more Flash needed!), comments, chat and lots of other improvements.

The transition to our new app for Google Drive should be smooth, but please donâ€™t hesitate to [contact us](https://balsamiq.com/company/contact/#/t?_k=b7w7tv) if you have any trouble, we're here to help!

## Installing Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive

Installing Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive can be done from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/balsamiq-wireframes-free/imbfadckkgblfbkinjejdeobpfbcopgb), just like any other Google Drive app.

After the installation, please make sure that Balsamiq Wireframes is [set as the default app](../installing/#setting-balsamiq-wireframes-as-the-default-app-for-balsamiq-files) for Balsamiq files.

If you have the previous version installed (Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Google Drive), we suggest to [uninstall it](https://docs.balsamiq.com/google-drive/b3/installing/#uninstalling) and enjoy the features and UI of the new app.

## Migrating Your Wireframes to the New Plugin

You can easily migrate any Balsamiq file to the new format by opening it with the new app.

Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive uses the same file format than the previous version of the add-on (BMPR) but it introduces new features that require an upgrade of the BMPR file format.

{{% alert info %}}**Note:** The new BMPR format is compatible with Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Desktop, so you could continue to use both without losing any data.{{% /alert %}}

## Backup Copy of the Previous BMPR File

During the migration process, a copy of the previous version of the BMPR file is saved as a backup. In case you need to retrieve it, see the [downgrading section](../transition/#downgrading) below.

## Licensing and Pricing

Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive uses the same licensing and pricing model than Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Google Drive, so no migration is needed! Sweet!

## Downgrading

Migrating to the new app should be smooth and we are pretty sure that once you will try Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive, you will never go back to the previous version.

However, in case you need to use the old Mockups 3 for Google Drive again, please follow these steps:

- [Uninstall](../installing/#uninstalling) Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive
- [Reinstall](https://docs.balsamiq.com/google-drive/installing/#installation) Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Google Drive
- Revert the BMPR file to the previous format (see details below)

During the migration process a copy of the previous version of the BMPR file has been saved as a backup. You can revert to the previous version of the file downloading the old version and uploading it again.

This last step will allow you to edit the BMPR file with Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Google Drive.
