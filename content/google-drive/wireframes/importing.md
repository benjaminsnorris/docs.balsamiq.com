## Importing Wireframes from Another Project

You can copy wireframes from one project to another using the Import/Export Wireframe JSON commands in the Project menu. Exporting to Wireframes JSON (Project > Export > Wireframe to JSON > Copy and Close) will copy the Balsamiq Wireframes code for the selected wireframe to the clipboard.

To create this wireframe in a new project, switch to it, choose “Import Wireframe JSON…” from the Project > Import menu and paste the copied code. Images and Symbols won't be copied, however.

## Importing from Other Versions of Balsamiq

If you have a project created in another Balsamiq product (using the .bmpr extension), you can just attach the file to the JIRA issue, refresh the page in order to let the [Balsamiq Wireframes panel](../intro/#using-the-balsamiq-wireframes-panel) appear and edit it directly.
