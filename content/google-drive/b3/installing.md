## Setting Balsamiq Mockups as the Default App for Mockups Files

Once installed, Google Drive may not know to open Balsamiq Mockups files with Mockups for Google Drive. After installation you should make sure that **Balsamiq Mockups Project is set as the default app for Balsamiq files.**

To do this go to the Google Drive settings (inside the gear icon menu in the upper-right corner), select the "Manage Apps" tab and make sure the "Use by default" checkbox is checked, as shown below.
