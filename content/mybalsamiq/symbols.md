If you want to use symbols in your site, there are 2 ways to create them: uploading a symbols library file from the desktop, or creating them when you're editing a project on the site.

First, make sure you read and understand the introduction to Symbols in generalÂ [here](/desktop/symbols/).

## Creating or Uploading Symbols Libraries

**To create a Symbols library within myBalsamiq**

![](//media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/myb/new-symbol-library.png)

*   Open an editor from any project.
*   Select the menu Project > New Symbol Library to open the dialog below.
*   In the dialog, select either **Project Assets** to create a symbol library for the current project, or **Site Assets** to create a symbol library that can be used by any project.
*   The editor will open up to the new Symbol Library, a Mockup file that you can use to create groups that will then show up as symbols in Project or Site assets.

**To upload a project with symbols created on the Desktop**

*   Create a project with Mockups that uses Symbols.
*   [Zip up your project and upload the whole project](/mybalsamiq/project/#uploading-and-downloading-projects). You can then move to myBalsamiq to edit things if you need to.
*   Your Symbols library should now show up in the Assets of the project you uploaded.

**To upload a Symbols library created on the Desktop**

*   Create your Symbols library file. Make sure your groups are named or they won't show up as Symbols.
*   Click the [Assets](/mybalsamiq/assets/) link in the header on any view, and upload the file to either Project Assets to create a symbol library for the current project or Site Assets to create a symbol library that can be used by any project. _(Step-by-step instructions available in the following article: [How to Use an Existing File as a Symbol in myBalsamiq](https://support.balsamiq.com/tutorials/filesymbolmyb/))_

## Using Symbols

When editing a Mockup, select the Project Assets or Site Assets tab in the UI Library and drag and drop your symbol into your mockup.
