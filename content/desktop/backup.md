Mockups 3 for Desktop backs up any file you open to a local folder. These local versions are stored for (around) seven days and should automatically load in case of a corrupted project file.

Versions of [Mockups 3 for Desktop](https://balsamiq.com/download) prior to 3.4 do not have the automatic recovery feature. This FAQ will show you how to recover the file manually.

## Backup Location

The backups are all stored in Mockups' Local Store, in a folder called LocalProjects. You can get there via the Balsamiq Mockups "About" dialog.

There is more information about finding your Local Store [here](/desktop/localstore/).

## Restoring Backups

Once you are in the [Local Store folder](/desktop/localstore/), find the project that you would like to restore, and double click it. That will open it in Mockups 3 for Desktop. From there, Select Project > Save As and save the file in a new location. Saving it allows both the backup and a new version of the file to exist, which keeps your data safe!

{{% alert info %}}**Note:** We do not recommend moving files out of the Local Store folder. If you want to move a backed up file to another folder, we recommend copying the file (CTRL/CMD+C), and then pasting it to the destination (CTRL/CMD+V). {{% /alert %}}
