Mockups includes a full screen presentation mode for presenting your wireframes to stakeholders or usability testing.

To enter Full Screen Presentation mode, just click on the full-screen icon in the top-right corner of Mockups, or select "Full Screen Presentation" from the View menu, or simply hit CTRL/CMD+F.

Mockups will expand to take up your whole screen (to eliminate distractions), and your mockup will be centered on the screen.

## Navigating between Mockups

You can navigate between mockups using the icons in the upper left. The far left icon will toggle the top bar on and off. You can turn it off to remove everything but the mockup (even the icon will disappear until the cursor is placed over it), this is useful for usability testing when you want a more realistic experience.

If you have created [links](/desktop/linking/) between your mockups, the links will be clickable in full screen presentation mode.

## Settings

By default you will also see a big **blue arrow** pointer in place of the regular mouse cursor. This is useful for presenting your mockups. The pointer will point towards the center of the screen in order to always stay out of the way of your mockup as much as possible.

You can turn off the big blue arrow in the full screen settings by clicking the gear icon in the top right to open the settings panel.

The settings panel also has an option to turn on and off **link hints**. When link hints are on areas that contain [links](/desktop/linking/) will be shown with a pink overlay so they can be seen easily.

The **Markup** setting is for showing and hiding [markup](/desktop/markup/) elements, such as Sticky Notes, Arrows and Callouts (any control under the "Markup" tab in the UI Library). This is useful if you want to just look at your UI without the annotations that surround it.

The last setting is to set the view to **zoom** out to fit the largest mockup. All other mockups will be zoomed relative to the largest mockup.

There are keyboard shortcuts for each setting, shown next to the setting name in the panel. No modifier key is required in full screen mode (e.g., just L for link hints, not CTRL/CMD+L)

The info icon next to the settings icon will open a panel to view and edit notes for the selected mockup, just like in normal edit mode.

To exit Full Screen Presentation mode, hit the ESC key or click the icon in the upper right corner.
