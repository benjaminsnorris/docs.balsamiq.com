Mockups 3 for JIRA Cloud was released January 18, 2016. We will soon be moving all JIRA Cloud instances to this new connect add-on, however, in the meantime, you may be using an older version of the plugin.

**If you haven't yet purchased Mockups for JIRA**, but have a Cloud instance older than January 18, 2016, you will have the older plugin pre-installed. You may have even trialed this version. As this older version will shortly be removed from your Cloud instance, we suggest you disable it via UPM, install the [Mockups for 3 JIRA Cloud](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.balsamiq.mockups.jira/cloud/overview) version, and trial this add-on. Here are details on [how it install the connect plugin](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.balsamiq.mockups.jira/cloud/installation).

**If you already purchased Mockups for JIRA** for your Cloud instance, continue to use and enjoy Mockups for JIRA!   Your users should reference the [Mockups for JIRA for Server User Guide](/jira/user-guide/) and the administration of your plugin works like [Mockups for Confluence for Cloud](/confluence/admin-guide-cloud/).

**We will soon be migrating your license to the new Mockups 3 for JIRA Cloud version.** We will be in contact by email regarding the details regarding your options in this licensing transition and the new pricing and license management in Atlassian Marketplace.
