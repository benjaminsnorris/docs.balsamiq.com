## A New File Format

In the old version of Balsamiq Mockups for JIRA Server, we stored each mockup in its own BMML attachment, and only linked to images.

Balsamiq Wireframes for JIRA Server introduces a new project file format called **BMPR**: everything that belongs to a project (wireframes, symbols, images, icons) is in a single file, saved as an attachment to your JIRA issue. This makes it much easier to link and keep everything together. Learn more about the new plugin [here](../intro/).

In order to take advantage of the new features, you need to migrate the old files to the new project format.

## Migrating Your Wireframes to the New Plugin

Once the new plugin is installed, visiting a JIRA page that has BMML attachments will show this warning:

Clicking “show more details" shows this message:

To start the conversion process for the BMMLS on this JIRA issue, just click the “Migrate to Balsamiq Wireframes for JIRA Server" button.

At the end of the migration you should then see the new Balsamiq Wireframes for JIRA Server panel, and two attachments: the BMPR file (that contains all of your wireframes and assets) and a ZIP file with the data in the old format, as a backup.
